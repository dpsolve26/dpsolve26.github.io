# Call for Papers

DPSOLVE 2026 invites submissions on all topics related to models and solvers for dynamic programming. The workshop aims to bring together researchers from different fields to discuss recent developments and future directions.

We welcome submissions on topics including, but not limited to:

*   Decision diagram-based optimization (DDOpt)
*   Domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP)
*   Integration of DP-based methods with Constraint Programming (CP) and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)
*   Applications of DP in formal methods, automated planning, and operations research
*   Algorithmic techniques for DP solvers
*   Standardization of modeling interfaces and benchmarks
*   Theoretical foundations of DP models and solvers

## Submission Types

We solicit two types of submissions:

*   **Full Papers:** Original research papers (up to 15 pages).
*   **Abstracts:** Short papers describing ongoing work or position statements (up to 4 pages).

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.

For details on how to submit, please see the [Submission page](./submission).
