</div>

**The 2nd Workshop on Models and Solvers for Dynamic Programming**

**Affiliated with the [Constraint Programming (CP) 2026 conference](http://cp2026.a4cp.org/) and the [FLoC 2026](https://www.floc26.org/) in Lisbon, Portugal.**

**Date: July 18-19, 2026 (Half-day event)**

This is the second edition of the workshop, following the successful [DPSOLVE 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/dpsolve2023).

Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental paradigm in optimization, artificial intelligence, and theoretical computer science. Recently, new directions have emerged around the use of domain-independent solving methodologies based on dynamic programming.

Following the successful CP 2023 workshop on the same topic, DPSOLVE 2026 will provide a forum to consolidate this growing research area, share progress, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. The workshop will strengthen connections with formal methods, automated planning, and operations research communities, while fostering discussions around algorithmic techniques, standardization of modeling interfaces, and benchmarks.

## Important Dates

*   **Extended Abstract Submission Deadline:** May 15 AoE 2026
